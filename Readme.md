## 🧪 Project Workflow & Steps

1. *Data Collection*  
   - Gathered vendor, brand, and sales data from internal sources.

2. *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*  
   - Removed records with zero sales, negative profit, and invalid margin data.
   - Filtered and normalized vendor-brand mappings.

3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Investigated outliers, correlations, and key statistics.
   - Identified underperforming vs. high-performing vendors.

4. *Statistical Validation*  
   - Used hypothesis testing to compare profit margins across groups.

5. *Dashboard Design*  
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with key KPIs, bar charts, donut charts, and scatter plots.

6. *Insight Generation & Reporting*  
   - Developed PDF report summarizing analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## 🎨 Visualization & Design

The Power BI dashboard was designed with clarity and business-readability in mind:
- ✅ High-level KPIs: Sales, Purchases, Gross Profit, Margin, Unsold Capital
- 📊 Bar charts for top vendors/brands
- 🎯 Donut chart for vendor purchase contribution
- ⚠ Highlighted low-performing vendors/brands visually
- 🔴 Color-coded scatter plot to separate high and low margin performers
